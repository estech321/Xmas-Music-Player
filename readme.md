# Christmas Music Player
This code can be run on an Arduino and plays some Christmas tunes and may or may not Rick Roll you!

## Hardware
You will need:
* Arduino Uno
* Piezo Buzzer or speaker
* [Adafruit RGB LCD Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/714)

## Software
This program is pretty self-contained. You will need the Adafruit RGB LCD Shield library and the Adafruit_MCP23017.h utility library.

## Credits
I used [@robsoncouto](https://github.com/robsoncouto)'s [arduino-songs](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs) code for playing the songs. I also used Adafruit's [Adafruit-RGB-LCD-Shield-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-RGB-LCD-Shield-Library) code to control the RGB LCD shield.
